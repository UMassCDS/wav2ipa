# Results Analysis and Visualizations

These notebooks create data analyses and visualizations to compare model performance on both Buckeye and TIMIT test sets.
Most of these analyses are final and intended to be included in published work, but some are exploratory and may not yield definitive conclusions.

Some examples of data explorations covered are:
- demographic performance imbalances across models: amp_evaluation_analysis.ipynb, timit_evaluation_analysis.ipynb
- error rates on vowel predictions compared with their Pillai scores: vowel_overlap_comparisons.ipynb
- performance comparisons after vowel reductions: buckeye_post_processing_evaluation.ipynb, timit_post_processing_evaluation.ipynb
